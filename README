This is a Command Pattern based service to execute CLI. 
It can used to combine multiple commands to execute and 
capture all outputs. standard execution from ruby doesn't capture
all outputs from terminal. This might be of help to those to capture all.
You can put it in your project and make use of it. 
Same command object can be used multiple times, just remeber to call execute! inplace of execute
to clear the command palette. If you want to use the same object. 
You can pass in your own logger to log everything in a logger or use a small log service
to supplemnt it, it can be downloaded from.
